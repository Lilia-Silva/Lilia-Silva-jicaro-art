      <h1>Portrait Project: Capturing a Soul in Jícara Mosaic</h1>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>This project marks a significant milestone in my artistic journey, 
         as it was the first time I dared to create a portrait of a human.
          And not just any portrait, but of my eldest daughter, whose natural 
          beauty and long flowing hair inspired me to capture her likeness in 
          the unconventional medium of jícara mosaic. This project presented 
          both technical and emotional challenges, as I was tasked with doing 
          justice to someone I hold so dear.</p>

      <h2>Materials and Preparation</h2>
   </div>
   <div >
      <p>For this portrait, I chose a large, irregularly shaped wood slab 
         as the base. This piece of wood provided an organic feel to the 
         project, enhancing the natural look of the jícara art. The 
         preparation process was similar to that of my previous works: 
         gathering the jícara shells, cleaning them, and painting them 
         with acrylics to achieve the variety of shades needed. However,
          what made this project particularly complex was working with 
          skin tones.</p>
   </div>

   <div>
      <p>One of the greatest challenges was achieving the subtle nuances 
         in human skin tones. The colors of human skin are incredibly 
         complex, and with jícara mosaic, each piece had to be 
         meticulously placed to create a gradient that appeared natural. 
         It required much planning, patience, and trial and error to 
         ensure the colors blended harmoniously and gave the appropriate 
         texture.

   <div>
      <p>The project took about a month and a half of continuous work. 
         I started with the most difficult areas, such as the face, 
         where the details and expressions are crucial to capturing my 
         daughter's essence. Every piece of jícara was hand-cut and 
         adjusted to fit perfectly in place, with special attention 
         paid to the shadows and highlights on her skin. It was a 
         laborious process, but incredibly rewarding to see her face 
         slowly emerge from the chaos of tiny jícara fragments.

         Her hair was another key element of the portrait. My daughter’s 
         long, flowing hair appeared to be in motion in the original 
         photo, and I wanted to replicate that dynamic movement in the 
         mosaic. I used a combination of dark and light tones, as well 
         as large and small fragments, to give the hair depth and a sense 
         of flowing movement.
      </p>
   </div>

      <h2>Technical and Emotional Challenges</h2>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>
         Beyond the technical challenges, this project was emotionally 
         charged. Creating a portrait of someone close to you adds an 
         extra layer of pressure because you're not just trying to 
         represent their physical features, but also their personality 
         and spirit. I wanted this portrait to reflect the energy and 
         light that my daughter radiates, which drove me to put my heart 
         into every single piece of jícara.
      </p>

<div>
   <p>Balancing the technique and emotion is what, in my opinion, makes 
      this portrait so special. Watching her face slowly take form from 
      the randomness of broken jícara pieces was an incredibly satisfying 
      experience.</p>

   <h2>
      Conclusion: A Labor of Love 
   </h2>
</div>
<div>
   <p>When I finished the project, I couldn't help but feel an immense 
      sense of pride. This mosaic not only represents a technical 
      achievement but also serves as a tribute to my daughter. Every 
      jícara fragment symbolizes the care and love I poured into this 
      piece, hoping to convey how much she means to me.</p>

   <p>I’m truly happy I took this step, daring to create a human portrait 
      in such a peculiar medium. And in the end, though the process was 
      challenging and sometimes exhausting, every moment was worth it.</p>
