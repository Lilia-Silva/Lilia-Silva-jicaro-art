      <h1>The Cat Portrait Project: A Mosaic Tribute to My Feline Companion</h1>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>Creating a mosaic with jícara pieces is always a unique and slow process,
          but this time, I had the honor of making a portrait of one of my greatest 
          critics: my cat.</p>

      <h2>Gathering Materials and Crafting the Vision</h2>
   </div>
   <div >
      <p>For this project, I decided to work on a round wooden base, adding an extra 
         challenge with its shape. Like in previous mosaics, the preparation of the jícara 
         was an essential step. The process involved collecting dried jícara shells, 
         cleaning them, and painting some with vibrant acrylic colors to create a lively 
         contrast.</p>

   <div>
      <p>As you can imagine, when working on a project featuring a cat, it’s necessary 
         to consult the subject of the portrait. My cat was always nearby, "supervising" 
         the process. Though, most of the time, this involved lounging on my workspace or 
         knocking over carefully sorted pieces. He had his opinions, but mostly through 
         sleepy blinks of approval.

      <h2>The Mosaic Process</h2>
   </div>
   <div>
      <p>
         With every jícara shell carefully broken into tiny pieces, I began the delicate 
         task of creating the mosaic, ensuring that each part of his fur was just right.
          Capturing the essence of his black and white patterns was a challenge, but one I 
          enjoyed. The intricate pieces slowly came together, from the distinct whiskers 
          to the intense gaze of his green eyes.

   <h2>
      Expert Input from the Feline Himself  
   </h2>
</div>
<div>
   <p>Throughout the project, my cat would occasionally stroll by to examine my work. 
      I'm pretty sure he was checking to ensure I captured his best side. When he wasn’t 
      observing, he was usually sleeping among the mosaic materials, acting as a muse in 
      his own way.</p>

 <h2>The Finishing Touches</h2>

   <p>Once the portrait was completed, I applied a final layer of resin to protect the art 
      and make the colors pop even more. This mosaic of my beloved cat is not just a 
      reflection of him but a playful reminder of the joy and chaos he brings to my 
      workspace.</p>
